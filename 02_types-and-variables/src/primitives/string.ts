console.log(string1); // prints s1
let string2: string = "s2";

//backquote (or backtick) has a special name, string interpolation, which allows injecting code inside the string
let interpolation1: string = `This contains the variable s1: ${string1} as well as ${string2}`;
let interpolation2: string = `Can invoke variable function: ${string1.substr(0, 1)} as well as any code like this addition: ${1 + 1}`;
console.log(interpolation1); // prints This contains the variable s1: s1 as well as s2
console.log(interpolation2); // prints Can invoke variable function: s as well as any code like this addition: 2

//Ð°nother feature of string interpolation is that you can add a line break without concatenated with a + sign
